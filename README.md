# MusicalLights

The purpose of this project is to create a sound reactive light system controlled by a Raspberry Pi. Input from a microphone is processed in real time and used to vary the brightness of a number of lights. 

Currently, each light is assigned a range of frequencies. The mean volume of sound over the frequency range determines the brightness of the light.
